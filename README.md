Group 21 – Final hand-in

When the program is run, the “Login” screen opens automatically. The user can choose to log in if he has an account or he can sign up by clicking the “Sign up as a new user” link.

When a user signs in, the home page gives an overview of all projects he belongs to. There the user can create new projects, delete projects, change user settings, and log out. By each project is the date it was created on, which user created it and of which type the project is. 

When a project is created, it must be given a name and the type of the project is chosen, with the options: website, mobile app, and other. If a website is created, a file named index.html is created in the project. When a mobile app is created, a file named index.js is created, while if a project is created with type other, a file named index.txt is created in the project.

By clicking the project the user wants to work on, the project screen opens, and all files belonging to it can be viewed.  On the project screen, files of different types can be added, the project can be shared with other users, files can be removed, user settings changed and the choice of returning back to the project screen is also available. A file is chosen and the editor opens for that file. 

When a file is created, it must be given a name and the type of the project is chosen, with the following options available: JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Text. A file is then created with the corresponding extension.

In the editor, the contents of the file can be viewed and changed. The file autosaves. If the project has been shared with other users, changes they make in real-time can be viewed. Also visible, is which user is making the changes, and in what line. A back button takes the user back to the Project’s overview.

In the user settings menu, the password can be changed, by inputting the current password, and then choosing the new password and confirming it.

We have error checks on all inputs, we have restrictions on passwords, and input is required in all fields. The password requirements are that there must be at least one uppercase, one lowercase and one digit, and the password must contain at least 6 characters.
Before a project or file can be deleted, the user is asked to confirm the choice, or cancel delete.
The username requirements have a maximum number of 42 characters, and input must not be registered already. Email requirements are that the input must not already be registered in the system, and there is a maximum of 100 characters. The projects have error checks on empty names and a maximum of 30 characters, but files have error checks on empty file names, a maximum of 25 characters in file names, and no files in the same project can be named the same. 

We are very satisfied with the websites look and functionality. The interface is user friendly and it should be easy for users to understand how the website works and how to use it.
